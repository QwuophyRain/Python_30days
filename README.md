# Python-in-30days: My Learning Journey üöÄ
This repository documents my personal journey of learning Python programming from the ground up in just 30 days. My goal is to build a strong foundation in Python, covering core concepts, data structures, object-oriented programming, and more.


## üéØ Goals
* **Learn Python Fundamentals:** Understand the basic syntax, data types, operators, and control flow.
* **Master Data Structures:** Become proficient with lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and learn about more advanced structures.
* **Explore Functions and Modules:** Learn to write reusable code and utilize Python's extensive standard library.
* **Dive into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Understand the principles of classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.
* **Practice Regularly:** Dedicate time each day to coding exercises and projects.
* **Build Small Projects:** Apply learned concepts by working on practical examples.
* **Track Progress:** Maintain a clear record of my daily learning activities and achievements.


## üìÖ 30-Day Plan (Tentative)
Here's a general outline of topics I plan to cover each day. This plan is flexible and may be adjusted based on my learning pace and interests.

**Week 1: Fundamentals**
* **Day 1:** Introduction to Python, Installation, Basic Syntax, Print Function, Comments.
* **Day 2:** Variables, Data Types (Integers, Floats, Strings, Booleans), Type Casting.
* **Day 3:** Operators (Arithmetic, Comparison, Logical, Assignment).
* **Day 4:** User Input, Type Conversion.
* **Day 5:** Control Flow: `if`, `elif`, `else` statements.
* **Day 6:** Loops: `for` loops, `range()` function.
* **Day 7:** Loops: `while` loops, `break` and `continue` statements.

**Week 2: Data Structures**
* **Day 8:** Lists: Introduction, creating lists, accessing elements, list methods.
* **Day 9:** Lists: List comprehensions, nested lists.
* **Day 10:** Tuples: Introduction, creating tuples, accessing elements, immutability.
* **Day 11:** Dictionaries: Introduction, creating dictionaries, accessing elements, dictionary methods.
* **Day 12:** Dictionaries: Iterating through dictionaries, nested dictionaries.
* **Day 13:** Sets: Introduction, creating sets, set operations.
* **Day 14:** Strings: String manipulation, string methods, string formatting.

**Week 3: Functions and Modules**
* **Day 15:** Functions: Defining functions, function arguments (positional, keyword, default).
* **Day 16:** Functions: `*args` and `**kwargs`.
* **Day 17:** Scope of Variables (Local vs. Global).
* **Day 18:** Lambda Functions.
* **Day 19:** Modules: Importing modules, standard library modules (e.g., `math`, `random`).
* **Day 20:** Creating Your Own Modules.
* **Day 21:** File Handling: Reading from files.

**Week 4: Intermediate Concepts & Introduction to OOP**
* **Day 22:** File Handling: Writing to files.
* **Day 23:** Error Handling: `try`, `except`, `finally` blocks.
* **Day 24:** Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - Concepts.
* **Day 25:** Classes and Objects: Defining classes, creating objects, attributes.
* **Day 26:** Methods: Instance methods, class methods, static methods.
* **Day 27:** Inheritance: Single inheritance.
* **Day 28:** Inheritance: Multiple inheritance.

**Week 5 (Partial): More OOP and Beyond**
* **Day 29:** Polymorphism.
* **Day 30:** Review and potentially a small final project.


## üí° How to Use This Repo (For Myself & Others)
* **Follow Along:** You can follow my learning journey by exploring the daily folders.
* **Review Notes:** My files will contain summaries of the concepts covered.
* **Run the Code:** The `.py` files will have code examples that you can run to understand the concepts in practice.
* **Contribute (If you wish to make this a collaborative learning space):** While this is primarily my personal journey, if you're also learning and find this useful, feel free to fork the repository and adapt it for your own use! (You can decide later if you want to accept contributions).
